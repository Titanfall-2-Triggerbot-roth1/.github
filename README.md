## 🧠 What Is a Triggerbot?

A **triggerbot** is a cheat that **monitors your crosshair** and fires instantly when an enemy walks into your aim. Unlike aimbots (which snap), triggerbots keep things subtle – giving you a massive edge while keeping you looking legit, especially in PvP.

Perfect for **sniping, hipfire weapons, Titan anti-crit hits**, or any situation where **reaction time is everything**.
